INTRODUCTION
In this assignment, we practice basic C programming concepts such as variable declaration, input/output, arithmetic operations, type conversion, and use of formulas to solve simple real-world problems. These exercises help in understanding how to manipulate data, perform calculations, and display results effectively.
